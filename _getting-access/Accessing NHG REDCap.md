<h4><strong>External &amp; Non-NHG Persons</strong></h4>
<p>Due to NHG cybersecurity policy restrictions, we are unable to provide
access to the NHG-REDCap system for External and Non-NHG persons.</p>
<p>If you are from another Singapore Public Healthcare Cluster/Institution
(ie: NUHS or Singhealth), we recommend that you check with your Cluster's
Clinical Research Unit/Office to see how you can get access to your Institution's
REDCap system to support your research activity.</p>

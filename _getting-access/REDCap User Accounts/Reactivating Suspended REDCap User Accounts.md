<h4><strong>Automatic Suspension of dormant User Accounts</strong></h4>
<p>REDCap User Accounts are automatically suspended for security reasons
if Users do not log in for more than&nbsp;90 calendar days.</p>
<p>If you see the following Error Message when you are attempting to login
to the NHG-REDCap system, it means your REDCap User Account for that REDCap
Server has been suspended.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>Users will not be able to login to their REDCap User Account until the
Account has been reactivated for use.</p>
<h4><strong>Submit Account Reactivation Request</strong></h4>
<p>Users may complete and submit a Reactivation Request themselves. Alternatively,
the User may authorize a Representative to submit the Reactivation Request
on their behalf.</p>
<p>Each Request can only be used to reactivate ONE REDCap Account Type.</p>
<p>If you need to re-activate BOTH Account Types (ie: for Staging and Production
Servers), you will need to submit TWO separate Requests. If you do not
use the Staging Server there is no need to reactivate it.</p>

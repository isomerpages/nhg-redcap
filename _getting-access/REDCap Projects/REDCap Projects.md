<h4><strong>REDCap Projects</strong></h4>
<p>A REDCap Project can be thought of as a 'Folder' or 'Container' used for
storing the entered data for a specific activity.</p>
<h4><strong>Projects on the REDCap Production Server</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG-REDCap Production Server is the <strong>regulated environment</strong> where
the REDCap Projects of <strong>approved activities</strong> are hosted, and
where approved data collection activities are conducted in strict compliance
to relevant regulations and policies.</p>
<p>REDCap Users <strong>cannot create Projects on the Production Server</strong> but
must submit a Project Request with the necessary documentations. Only
<a href="https://redcapsupport.gri.nhg.com.sg/supported-activities/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">approved activities</a>will be hosted on the Production Server.</p>
<h4><strong>Projects on the REDCap Staging Server</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG-REDCap Staging Server is intended <strong>strictly for Testing and Learning purposes only</strong>.</p>
<p>Users are allowed to create Projects themselves on the Staging Server.</p>
<p>However, <strong>REAL, ACTUAL DATA is&nbsp;<u>NOT PERMITTED</u>&nbsp;under any circumstances,&nbsp;<em>including for testing purposes</em>, to be entered or saved on the Staging Server.</strong>

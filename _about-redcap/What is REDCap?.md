<p>Developed in 2004 by Vanderbilt University, REDCap is intended to help
researchers collect and manage data for small-to-medium sized projects.</p>
<p>With REDCap's simple menu-driven interface, researchers can quickly and
easily create web-based data capture forms with features like branching-logic
questions, user access control, multi-visit data capture and real-time
data entry validation without the need for any programming or specialist-IT
knowledge.</p>

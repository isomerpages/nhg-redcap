<p><strong>REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)</strong> is an easy-to-use
web application designed to support electronic data capture in a secured
and systematic manner.</p>
<p>Developed in 2004 by Vanderbilt University, REDCap is intended to help
researchers collect and manage data for small-medium sized projects.</p>
<p>By using REDCap's simple menu-driven interface, researchers can quickly
create web-based data capture forms with features like branching-logic
questions, user access control, multi-visit data capture and real-time
data entry validation without the need for any programming or specialist-IT
knowledge.</p>

<p>The National Healthcare Group (NHG) is a member of the REDCap Consortium
which, in 2024, has 7,357 active partners in 159 countries who utilize
and support REDCap in various ways. In Singapore, all three public healthcare
clusters (NHG, NUHS, Singhealth) host and support their own REDCap systems.</p>
<p>The NHG-REDCap system was first launched in 2016 and is jointly administered
and maintained by NHG's Group Research &amp; Innovation (GRI) and Synapxe.</p>

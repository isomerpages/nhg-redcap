<p>The NHG REDCap System is intended primarily to support approved Human-Subject
Research Activities as defined and regulated by the NHG-Domain Specific
Review Boards (DSRB).</p>
<p>At present, the following categories of activities may apply to use NHG-REDCap:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>DSRB-Approved Human Subject Research Activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registered Standing Databases &amp; Tissue Banks (for potential future
research)
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Excluded Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG-REDCap system is not configured as a "High-Availability" system.
Hence NHG-REDCap cannot be used for delivering Clinical Service/Care/Operations
and any other mission-critical activities. In addition, NHG-REDCap cannot
be used as the basis for providing a contract or other services to any
entity.</p>

<h4><strong>External &amp; Non-NHG Persons</strong></h4>
<p>Due to NHG cybersecurity policy restrictions, we are unable to provide
access to the NHG-REDCap system for External and Non-NHG persons.</p>
<p>If you are from another Singapore Public Healthcare Cluster/Institution
(ie: NUHS or Singhealth), we recommend that you check with your Cluster's
Clinical Research Unit/Office to see how you can get access to your Institution's
REDCap system to support your research activity.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Supported Activities</strong></h4>
<p>NHG-REDCap is available for use by the following research activities:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Approved Human Subject Research Activities (as reviewed and approved by
NHG DSRB)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Registered Standing Databases &amp; Tissue Banks (for potential future
research)
<br>
</p>
<h4><strong>Excluded Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG-REDCap system is not configured as a "High-Availability" system
and is subject to unplanned downtime.</p>
<p>Hence NHG-REDCap cannot be used for delivering Clinical Service/Care/Operations
and any other mission-critical activities. In addition, NHG-REDCap cannot
be used as the basis for providing a contract or other services to any
entity.</p>

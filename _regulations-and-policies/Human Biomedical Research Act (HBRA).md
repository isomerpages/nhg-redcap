<p>Research should always be conducted with integrity, and be of reliable
quality to ensure that the health, welfare and safety of research participants
remain a paramount consideration at all times.</p>
<p>The Human Biomedical Research Act provides clarity regarding the roles
and responsibilities of individuals and body corporates involved in human
biomedical research and the handling of human tissue for use in research.</p>
<p>Through the legislation, the Ministry of Health (MOH) strives to ensure
that human biomedical research and tissue banking activities carried out
in Singapore follow the law and principles of good clinical practice relating
to ethics and science to protect the safety and welfare of research subjects
and tissue donors.</p>

<p>Research should always be conducted with integrity and be of reliable
quality to ensure that the health, welfare and safety of research participants
remain a paramount consideration at all times.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Section 27 of the Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA) states that:</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every person who has obtained individually-identifiable information or
human biological material for the purposes of human biomedical research
must take all reasonable steps and safeguards as may be necessary, including
rendering information or material non-identifiable, to protect such information
or material against accidental or unlawful loss, modification or destruction,
or unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>
<p>Any person who contravenes these requirements in HBRA shall be guilty
of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine or to imprisonment
or to both."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Singapore's <strong>Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA)</strong> provides
clarity regarding the roles and responsibilities of individuals and body
corporates involved in human biomedical research and the handling of human
tissue for use in research.</p>
<p>Through the legislation, the Ministry of Health (MOH) strives to ensure
that human biomedical research and tissue banking activities carried out
in Singapore follow the law and principles of good clinical practice relating
to ethics and science to protect the safety and welfare of research subjects
and tissue donors.</p>

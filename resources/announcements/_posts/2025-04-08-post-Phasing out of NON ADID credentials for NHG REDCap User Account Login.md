<h4><strong>(A) WHAT THIS IS ABOUT</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Due to legacy compatibility issues, some NHG-REDCap users were initially
issued with NON-ADID based REDCap User Accounts instead of NHG-ADID based
User accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, these compatibility issues have been resolved, and we are now
phasing out the use of these NON-ADID User accounts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>(B) HOW DOES THIS AFFECT NHG-REDCAP USERS</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For the vast majority of existing REDCap Users, it is “business-as-usual”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a small number of NHG REDCap Users are impacted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving forward, NHG-REDCap will no longer issue NON-ADID based User Accounts.
Only NHG Staff with valid NHG-ADID accounts will be eligible to apply for
NHG-REDCap User Accounts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>(C) WHAT DO I NEED TO DO IF I AM AFFECTED</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The NHG-REDCap Administrator will be reaching out to affected REDCap Users
to assist them in migrating their NON-ADID User Accounts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

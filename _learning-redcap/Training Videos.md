<p>If you are new to REDCap, we highly recommend that you take some time
to watch these videos below. The videos will help you to get started on
the basics of&nbsp; the REDCap system and provide a general overview for
some of REDCapâ€™s preliminary concepts and features.
<br>
<br><strong>Note: </strong>New versions of REDCap are released frequently,
so the videos and other training resources below may reflect earlier software
versions and thus may look slightly different than your system. Always
refer to the REDCap software's built-in prompts and instructional text
for the most current information.
<br>
<br>Do note that any references to policies and regulatory requirements in
these videos are <strong>NOT APPLICABLE</strong> to NHG's REDCap Users. Instead,
NHG RECap users should refer to NHG's REDCap Policies for more information.</p>
<p>Please be aware that NHG has no control over external video links available

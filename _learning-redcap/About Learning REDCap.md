<p>REDCap is intended to be a primarily "Self-Service" tool where researchers
can develop and deploy a REDCap Project with minimal IT Support.</p>
<p>Users are expected to learn to use REDCap via the User Guides, Tutorial
Videos, the built-in Frequently Asked Questions knowledge bank, and embedded
documentation.</p>
<p>These learning resources all work together to guide the researcher in
the learning and use of the system.</p>

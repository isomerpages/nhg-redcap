<p><strong>Using Longitudinal-mode Projects</strong>
<br>Users can "switch" a Project from the default Classic-mode to Longitudinal-mode.
In Longitudinal-mode, this enables users to enter data to Forms/Instruments
which designated to pre-defined Events or Visits. This enables different
Forms to be used for different Events, or the same Form can be used for
multiple Events. Longitudinal-mode also allows Events to be divided into
different Arms (or groups/populations). Thus in this way, Arms can be used
to distinguish between different groups/populations of Participants, and
to cater to different data collection needs of the different Arms.</p>
